Some photos are my roommate’s cause I took photos by my phone, I’m not sure if I can use them. People in Bolivia are simple and enthusiasm. They seldom see foreigners, so when we arrived, kids were so curious about us, and gave the most precious food to us. As a gift, I gave them chocolates. The salt flats is amazing place where all you can see is whiteness: no sounds, almost no life, just white salt everywhere. Also, there is a cactus that you can only see it in Bolivia, they are really tall, I was told that the tallest cactus can be 10 meters. When I stand in the middle of cactus, like I’m a hobbit.</p>"
