			<p>We created Dashlane for the two billion people that use the web.</p>
			<p>Everyone that uses the web today faces some version of the password problem. Many know that their passwords are unsafe, either because they’re trivial to crack or they’re reused on several websites. Many others forget their passwords and stop using services, or shy away from new online services altogether – because remembering passwords and registering for new websites with new passwords is a pain.</p>
			<p>And these folks are also constantly annoyed by having to type out long <p>strings of meaningless numbers, dates, and codes to conduct a simple act of buying online (or even more painfully, on their mobile device) – an act that is as simple as a swipe in the physical world.</p>
			<p>We created Dashlane to solve these problems with one neat solution that is simple, secure, and universal. Our users don’t trade security for convenience – they get both.</p>
			<p>We created Dashlane because we are on a mission to fix the internet.</p>
